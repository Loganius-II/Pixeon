# PIXEON: Picture Exploration & Neural Training Module
## Say hello to the pixeon pigeon!
![Pixeon Pigeon](https://github.com/Loganius-II/Pixeon/blob/main/PIXEON_PIGEON.png)
## Overview:
   - A module, you could say, that you can use for determining picture accuracy
   - The main.py is what you want, everything else was just my "progress" saves
   - See main.py for examples in the `if __name__ == '__main__': blah blah`
   - The point of this is to compare images and using the `catagorize` function, you can compare a bulk of images.
   - Unfortunately, you must pass a path list of all of the pictures and not the directory that contains the images.
   - Make sure that the MLP (Machine learning Picture/Path) is a list if you are wanting to catagorize, and a string if you want to just compare two images
   - Not really a consistant project, but rather an idea I slopped together with just enough effort to get the job done

# My Uses:
 - The whole reason that I created this in the first place was to make a homemade, inefficient, probably not 100% accurate face recognition system for my socket servers.
 - also just a cool concept
# NOTE:
### My pixeon package source code is in the `pixeon 0.0.1` (or what ever the version is) directory
## PIP INSTALL WITH `pip install pixeon` or `python -m pip install pixeon` and for python3: `python3 -m pip install pixeon` 
## Thanks
